This script utilizes the X86DemoBoard to run a simple Ubuntu boot. The script
will boot the the OS to login before exiting the simulation.
This script has a `--ticks` argument that allows the user to specify the number
of ticks to simulate before exiting. If no `--ticks` argument is provided, the
simulation will run until the OS exits upon login.
A detailed terminal output can be found in `m5out/system.pc.com_1.device`.
Usage
-----
```sh
scons build/X86/gem5.opt -j `nproc`
./build/X86/gem5.opt configs/example/gem5_library/x86-ubuntu-run-to-tick.py \
    --ticks 100000000
