# Multi ISA

These tests check that all our ISAs are both currrently supported within gem5, as well as checking that get_runtime_isa() works as expected.

To run these tests by themselves, you can run the following command in the tests directory:

```bash
./main.py run gem5/multi_isa --length=[length]
```
